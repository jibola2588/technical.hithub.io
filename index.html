        <p>Javascript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.it is a small and lightweight language.Inside a host a host environment (for example, a web browswer), javascript can be connected to the object
 of its environment to provide programmatic controlover them.</p>
 <p>Javascript contains a standard library of objects,such as Array,Date,and Math, and a core set set of language elements such as operators,control structures, and statements.Core javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes
     by supplementing it with additional objects;<br>for examples;
 </p>
 <ul>
     <li>Client-side javascript extends the core language
         by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
      Object Model(DOM).For example,Client side extensions allow an application to
      place elements on an HTML form and response to user events such as mouse
    clicks,form input and page navigation.
    </li>
   <p> <li>Server-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
        Javascript on a server to running Javascript on a server.For example,server-side extensions allow
        an application to communicate with a database,provide continuity of information from one invocation
        to another of the application,or perform file manipulations on a server.

            <header>Javascript and Java</header>
        <p>Javascript and java are similar in some way but
            fundamentally different in some others.The javascript language
        resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
    Javascript follows Java expression syntax,naming conventions and basic control-flow
constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from Livescript to Javascript. </p>
<p>In contrast to java's compile-time system of classes built by decelarations,Javascript
    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
    Boolean,and string values.Javascript has a prototype-based object model instead of more
    common class-based object model.The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance;
    that is,what is inherited can vary for individual objects.Javascript also supports functions
    without any special declarative requirements.Functions can be properties of objects,
    executing as loosely typed methods.
</p>
<p>Javascript is a very free-form language compared to java.You do not have to declare all 
    variables,classes, and methods.You do not have to be concerned with whether methods 
    are public,private,or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.Variables,
    parameters,and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <p>To get started with writing Javascript,open the scratchpad and write your first
                "Hello world"Javacript code:</p>
                <code>
                    <div class="code">
                    function greetme(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);}
                    greetMe("World");
                </div></code><p>
                select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        <article>
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.The names
                of variables,called identifiers,conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>A Javacript identifier must start with a letter,underscore(_),or dollar sign($);
                subsequent characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" 
                through "z"(lowercase) </p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as a and u in identifiers.
                    You can also use unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
                    Some examples of legal naes Number_hits,temp99,and_name.  </p>

      <article>
      <header>Declaring variables </header>
     <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
     <p>with the keyword var.For example,</p>
    <code>
        <div class="code">
        var x = 42.</div>
    </code>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
    <p>By simply assigning it a value.For example,</p>
<code>
    <div class="code">
    x = 42.</div>
</code> 
<p>This always declares a global variable.It generates a strict Javascript
    warming.You  shouldn't use variant.
</p>   
<p>With the keyboard let.For example,</p>
<code>
    <div class="code">
    let y = 13.</div>
</code>
<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.See variable
    scope below.
</p>
</article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
       <article>
           <header>Variable scope</header>
       <p>When you declare outside of any function,it is called a global variable
           because it is available to any other code in the current document.When
            you declare a variable within a function,it is called a local variable,
           because it is available only within that function.
       </p>
       <p>Javascript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
           rather,a variable declared within a block is local to the function
           (or global scope)that the block resides within.For example the following
        code will log 5,because the scope of x is the function(or global context)
         within which x is declared,not the block,which in this case is an if 
         statement</p>
         <code>
             <div class="code">
             if (true){ var x = 5; }
            console.log(x); // 5
            </div></code>
            <p>This behaviour changes,when using the let declaration introduced
                in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <code><div class="code">
                if (true) {let y = 5; }
                console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y 
                is not 
                defined
            </div></code>

                <header>Global Variables</header>
          <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.
              In web pages the global object is window,so you can setb and
               access global variable using the window.variable syntax.  </p>
            
            <p>Consequently,you can access global variables declared in
                 one window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                  name.For example,if a variable called phoneNumber is 
                declared in a document,you can refer to this variable from
            an iframe as parent.phoneNumber. </p>
                </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="constant">
            <article>
         <header>Constant</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only,named constant with keyword.
        The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for 
        variable identifier:it must start with a letter,underscore
         or dollar sign and can contsin alphabetic,numeric,or 
         underscore characters. 
    </p>    
    <code><div class="code">
        const PI = 3.14;
    </div></code>
    <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
    re-declared while the script is running.It has to be 
    initialized to a value.
</p>
<p>
    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let
     block scope variables.If the const keyword is omitted,the 
     identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
</p>
<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function
    or variable in the same scope.For example:
</p>
<code>
    <div class="code">
    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function
    f() {}; const = 5;// THIS WILL CAUSE
    AN ERROR ALSLO function f() {
        const g = 5; var g; //statements}
</div></code>
<p>However,objects attributes are not protected,so the following 
    statement is executed without problems.
</p>
<code>
    <div class="code">
    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};<br>
    MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue"; 
</div></code>

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <article><header>Data types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data
                types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitive
  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean.true and false.</li>
                    <li>null.A special keyword denoting a null value.
                        Because Javascript is case-sensitive,null is
                        not the same as Null.
                    </li>
                    <li>undefined.A top-level property whose value is
                        undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Number.42 or 3.14159.</li>
                   <li>string,"Howdy"</li>    
                   <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).A data type 
                       whose instances are unique and immutable.
                    </li>              
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small
                amount,they enable you to perform useful functions 
                with your applications.Objects and functions are the 
                other fundamental elements in the language.You can 
                think of objects as named as containers for values,
                and functions as procedures that your application can perform. 
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="else_statement">
       <article>
           <header>if ...else statement</header>
           <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical 
               condition is true.Use the optional else clause to execute
               a statement if the condition is false.An if statement looks as follows:
           </p>
           <code><div class="code">
               if (condition){ statement_1; } 
               else { statement_2; }
           </div></code>
           <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
               See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.
               If condition evaluates to true,statement_1 is executed;otherwise,statement
               _2 is executed.Statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,including 
               further nested if statements.
           </p>
           <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions
